        I have been a full-time freelance statistician and R programmer since
        November 2012. Most of my projects are with clients working in drug
        discovery, but I have worked with clients from a variety of other fields
        including retail, human resources, psychiatry and health care. I am also an Honorary Research Fellow of the Statistics
        Department at the University of Warwick, continuing to engage in
        activites related to my earlier work in the department.

      <p>
	I am on the editorial board of the <a href=
        "http://www.jstatsoft.org/" title="Journal of Statistical Software">Journal of
        Statistical Software</a>. Previously I have served on the editorial board of <a href=
        "http://journal.r-project.org/" title="The R Journal">The R
        Journal</a>, where I was Editor-in-chief in 2011. I regularly serve on the program
        committee for the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/conferences.html"
        title = "useR! conference">useR! conference</a> and have been Program Chair in 2011, 2017 and 2019. I am a
        member-at-large on the board of the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/foundation/board.html">R Foundation</a> and I chair the R Foundation

      <h2>Employment History</h2>
      <p> When I started out as a freelancer, I had a part-time position
        as a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Warwick,
        UK. In this role, I worked with <a href=
        "http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic/firth/"
         title="Professor David Firth">Professor David Firth</a> on
        applications of generalized nonlinear models.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first nine months of 2011, I worked as a
        statistician at Pfizer PharmaTherapeutics R&amp;D providing
        support to biologists and chemists working in early drug
        discovery. I had particular responsibility for the primary
        pharmacology and high throughput screening groups,
        providing expertise in areas such as dose response analysis
        and statistical process control. During this time I
        co-developed the <b><a href="r-packages.html#gsclcca"
        title="Dr Heather Turner - gslcca">gslcca</a></b> package
        for the analysis of data from Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before moving to Pfizer I spent six years working as a
        researcher at the University of Warwick, again working with
        Professor David Firth. Our research activity focused on the
        development of methods and software for generalized
        nonlinear models, and we were awarded the <strong><a href=
        "http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/index.html" title=
        "John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award">2007 John M.
        Chambers Statistical Software Award</a></strong> for the
        resultant package <b><a href="r-packages.html#gnm" title=
        "Dr Heather Turner - gnm">gnm</a></b>. We also worked on
        models for paired comparisons, which we implemented in the
        <b><a href="r-packages.html#BradleyTerry2" title=
        "Dr Heather Turner - BradleyTerry2">BradleyTerry2</a></b>
        package.
      </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I obtained my PhD in 2005 on the topic of <b>biclustering
        microarray data</b>, supervised by Professors Trevor Bailey
        and Wojtek Krzanowski at the University of Exeter. The
        plaid model algorithm of the <a href=
        "http://cran.r-project.org/package=biclust">biclust</a>
        package, developed by Sebastian Kaiser and colleagues, is
        based on the algorithm and R code developed in this thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        My undergraduate degree is in Applied Statistics from the
        University of Reading, UK. During this time I spent a year
        working at the Institute of Arable Crop Research,
        University of Bristol, providing statistical support for
        scientists and developing a Genstat procedure for modelling
        seed germination.
