# Development of the mailing lists

Early days: 
 - Robert, Ross & Martin handle bug reports and releases by email.
 - Robert & Ross maintain small mailing list
 
Martin establishes automated mailing lists
 - 1996: *r-testers*
 - 1997: *r-announce*, *r-help*, *r-devel*
 
This supports the community and accelerates development of R and R "extensions".

# Comprehensive R Archive Network

1997: CRAN formed by Kurt Hornik (TU Wien) 

- Official R source distribution provided by R&R
- Extension packages: acepack, bootstrap, ctest, date, e1071, fracdiff, gee, jpn, oz,
snns, splines, survival4
- Documentation and Debian binaries of packages

Mirrors in USA and Switzerland.

R developers could submit package to CRAN via FTP.
