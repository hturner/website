# Collaborative coding

GitHub makes it easier to contribute to other people's packages
 - Check the URL in the package DESCRIPTION file to see if it has a GitHub
 - Use issues to report a bug/suggest a feature
 - Look at issues for opportunities to contribute
    - Check if project has guidelines in a CONTRIBUTING file
    - Ask if maintainer would accept a PR (pull request)
