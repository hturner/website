# Current Challenges

User Community

- outreach beyond white women

Developer community

- widening participation from underrepresent groups

---

# Outreach to minority groups

Two principles in tension

&gt; Nothing about us without us
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;common saying esp. among disability activists&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;Toni Morrison&lt;/cite&gt;

---

# Moving Forward: Being Allies

We have to work on being allies to minority groups

- Let minority groups set the agenda
- Work to lessen the burdens
- Create space for them
- Promote their activities
- Amplify their voices

- Hoping to scale up next year to include hubs in e.g. Africa, Latin America, Asia
    - reduce environmental cost with maximum in-person interaction
    - reduce financial cost
    - reduce travel time
    - potential to allow languages other than English
    - potential to incorporate remote participation
    - avoid visa issues

# Accessibility of R Conferences/Events

Liz Hare has been leading the development of best practices for events
[github.com/forwards/event_best_practices](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/master/DRAFTEventBestPracticesDisability.md)

Informed call for proposals for useR! 2021, e.g. asking if venue had
 - step-free access
 - gender-neutral bathrooms
 - disabled parking close to venue
 - policy allowing children on premises

Aim to integrate recommendations throughout organization for 2021.

---

# Best Practices for Accessible Content

 - (R-specific) advice for presenters at useR!
    - design and format of slides
    - language
 - Advice for conference social media
    - not putting key information in images
    - not making alcohol a focus
    
---

# Ally Actions

- Educate yourself/others on accessibility
   - aim to improve content shared at conferences/meetups/online
   - be aware of resources to share with those that need it
- Give feedback on draft best practices

---

# General Ally Actions

- Organizers: use best practices in your events
    - Noa Tamir is working on [guide for meetups](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/meetup-advice/meetup_best_practices.md)
- Expand your network
    - Seek out people not like yourself on Twitter, at conferences
- Share opportunities
    - Coding projects
    - Internships
    - Organizational roles
    
---

# R Foundation Actions?

- Better information on R project webpage
    - Pointers to community groups, including #rstats Twitter
    - Information on resources for blind R users
    - Information about Forwards!
- Adopt BlindRUG mailing to ensure its sustainability

# Developer Meetings

---

# Developer-focused meetings co-located with useR!

Directions in Statistical Computing (2014-2019)
 - Both invited speakers and invited participants
 - Mostly R Foundation members, plus special guests
 - Prior to useR!
 
R Implementation Optimization and Tooling (2016-2019)
 - Open call for speakers, open to useR! participants
 - Parallel with useR!
 
---

# Barriers to Inclusion

Invited workshops
 - Special guests can feel out of place
 - Community members that would be interested are left out
 - Information is not shared
 
Satellite events
 - May not make same effort to reach out to underrepresented groups
 - Very little promotion to general community
 - Details hidden away on separate website
 
Can expect new contributors to come as experts already
 
---

# Work in Progress

DSC 2020 
 - Speakers are invited, but anyone can attend
 
RIOT 2019
 - First time RIOT was advertised on useR! 2019 website
 
Room for improvement
 - Better liaison with R Foundation Conference Committee and useR! organizers
 - Better promotion of events, with a focus on diversity
 - Alternative formats (e.g. breakout session) to enable new contributors

# Package development workshops

Forwards package development [workshop materials](https://github.com/forwards/workshops/tree/master/York2020_01)
 - full day and 2 hour versions
 - Workshop run in Auckland, Budapest, Chicago, York
 - Upcoming in Johannesburg, Montevideo
 - Working on [guide](https://forwards.github.io/workshops-guide/) for other to run workshop

# Reluctance/Nervousness to Submit to CRAN

- Bad experience on CRAN/official mailing list
    - Decide to not to publish/host on GitHub
- Hoops to jump through
    - A lot of information to digest: CRAN Repository Policy, Checklist for New Submissions
    - Involved process: updating NEWS, DESCRIPTION, running checks and tests
- R-package-devel provides limited support
    - can still be an intimidating experience
    - focus on specific questions
    
---

# Basic Onboarding?

- rOpensci have onboarding process that includes code review
    - scalable?
- Potential for basic onboarding service for first-time (underrepresented) submitters
    - guidance through checklist
    - help with errors/issues that come up in checks/tests
    - help solve issues identified by CRAN
    - give guidance on resubmission as they "graduate"
- Work with CRAN support team to keep Checklist for New Submissions up-to-date

# Python Core Dev: Adding Women to the Team

&gt; I want at least two female core Python Devs in the next year
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;PyCon 2015, Guido van Rossum&lt;/cite&gt;

From [Victor Stinner's PyCon 2019 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3UmUj9h_Eo):

2016: 0 women core devs
2017: 2 women core devs
2018: 4 women core devs
2019: 5 women core devs

~ 30 active core devs

# Process of Becoming a Python Core Developer

.pull-left[
Mariatta Wijaya (first woman Python core dev) described process in her [PyCon 2018 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI)

- Read the Dev Guide [devguide.python.org](https://devguide.python.org/)
- Join core-mentorship and python-dev
- Find issue in bugs.python.org
- Propose pull request

*All* these steps can be done by non-core members

# Getting to be Invited to Be a Python Core Developer

Promotion to core dev depends on trust

Trust earnt by core devs getting to know people via
 - Pull requests (PRs)
 - PR review
 - Interacting on mailing lists, IRC, Zulip
 - Becoming a Developer on issue tracker (able to triage issues)
 
---

# Mentoring

Victor Stinner in his [PyCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3UmUj9h_Eo) 
proposes mentoring as a scalable solution to both *core dev burnout* and *lack of diversity*
 - [Notes on Mentoring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vstinner/talks/master/2018-PyconUS/contributors.pdf) typically a few emails a week, less onerous than GSoC

Recent/current work by Python Core devs
 - Move to GitHub (2017)
 - Document promotions process (dev guide)
 - Mentoring guide 
 - Contributor tutorial
 - Core dev office hours (public and private)
 - Adding enforcement procedure to code of conduct
 
---

# More Ideas from Other Communities

Rust: [mentored projects](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/06/27/Increasing-Rusts-Reach.html) (diversity scholarships)
 - mentees invest 2-5 hours per week over 3 months
 - expenses paid scholarship to Rust conference following year
 
Various: [outreachy projects](outreachy.org) for underrepresented groups
 - paid internship, 40 hours per week over 3 months
 - require mentor(s) to invest 5 hours per week
 
???

vs 2-3 hours for google summer of code project

# Outreach from R Core

Tomas Kalibera and Luke Tierney wrote call for help [Reviewing Bug Reports](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/index.html) in October 2019

Could do more to reach out to underrepresented groups
 - Core devs/bugzilla veterans could offer mentoring/tutorial
 - Work with Forwards, R-Ladies, etc to reach potential contributors
 - Blog post could become part of more comprehensive Developer Guide
 
---

# Input from R Community

Micheal Lawrence has floated idea of Requests For Proposals on perceived 
deficiencies in R
 - community teams propose solutions
 
Possible consider equivalent of python-ideas mailing list.
 
---

# More involvement of R Core in useR!

At useR! 2020
 - outreach slot adjoining keynote talk
 - parallel session dedicated to R Core speakers
 - tutorial by Tomas Kalibera on contributing to base R
 
Consider making room for more personal interactions
 - conscious effort to mix at social events
 - opportunity for participants to book time with one/more R core person?
 - R core booth? Live coding lounge? AMA session?
 
???

10 min talk plus 10 min Q &amp; A

# Summary

We can all support community-driven efforts for better inclusion of 
under-represented groups
 - Forwards is working well here
 
A lot of ideas from outside and inside R community of how to get more 
contributors from under-represented groups
 - Currently don't have enough active members on Forward on-ramps team
 - Needs active participation of R Core and other contributors
