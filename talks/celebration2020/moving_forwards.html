# Current Challenges

User Community

- outreach beyond white women

Developer community

- widening participation from underrepresent groups

---

# Outreach to minority groups

Two principles in tension

&gt; Nothing about us without us
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;common saying esp. among disability activists&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;Toni Morrison&lt;/cite&gt;

---

# Moving Forward: Being Allies

We have to work on being allies to minority groups

- Let minority groups set the agenda
- Work to lessen the burdens
- Create space for them
- Promote their activities
- Amplify their voices

    - reduce financial cost
    - reduce travel time
    - potential to allow languages other than English
    - potential to incorporate remote participation

# Accessibility of R Conferences/Events

Liz Hare has been leading the development of best practices for events
[github.com/forwards/event_best_practices](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/master/DRAFTEventBestPracticesDisability.md)

Informed call for proposals for useR! 2021, e.g. asking if venue had
 - step-free access
 - gender-neutral bathrooms
 - disabled parking close to venue
 - policy allowing children on premises

Aim to integrate recommendations throughout organization for 2021.

---

# Best Practices for Accessible Content

 - (R-specific) advice for presenters at useR!
    - design and format of slides
    - language
 - Advice for conference social media
    - not putting key information in images
    - not making alcohol a focus
    
---

# Ally Actions

- Educate yourself/others on accessibility
   - aim to improve content shared at conferences/meetups/online
   - be aware of resources to share with those that need it
- Give feedback on draft best practices

---

# General Ally Actions

- Organizers: use best practices in your events
    - Noa Tamir is working on [guide for meetups](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/meetup-advice/meetup_best_practices.md)

# Developer Meetings

---

# Developer-focused meetings co-located with useR!

Directions in Statistical Computing (2014-2019)
 - Both invited speakers and invited participants
 - Mostly R Foundation members, plus special guests
 - Prior to useR!
 
R Implementation Optimization and Tooling (2016-2019)
 - Open call for speakers, open to useR! participants
 - Parallel with useR!
 
---

# Barriers to Inclusion

Invited workshops
 - Special guests can feel out of place
 - Community members that would be interested are left out
 - Information is not shared
 
Satellite events
 - May not make same effort to reach out to underrepresented groups
 - Very little promotion to general community
 - Details hidden away on separate website
 
Can expect new contributors to come as experts already
 
---

# Work in Progress

DSC 2020 
 - Speakers are invited, but anyone can attend
 
RIOT 2019
 - First time RIOT was advertised on useR! 2019 website
 
Room for improvement
 - Better liaison with R Foundation Conference Committee and useR! organizers
 - Better promotion of events, with a focus on diversity
 - Alternative formats (e.g. breakout session) to enable new contributors

# Reluctance/Nervousness to Submit to CRAN

- Bad experience on CRAN/official mailing list
    - Decide to not to publish/host on GitHub
- Hoops to jump through
    - A lot of information to digest: CRAN Repository Policy, Checklist for New Submissions
    - Involved process: updating NEWS, DESCRIPTION, running checks and tests
- R-package-devel provides limited support
    - can still be an intimidating experience
    - focus on specific questions
    
---

# Basic Onboarding?

- rOpensci have onboarding process that includes code review
    - scalable?
- Potential for basic onboarding service for first-time (underrepresented) submitters
    - guidance through checklist
    - help with errors/issues that come up in checks/tests
    - help solve issues identified by CRAN
    - give guidance on resubmission as they "graduate"
- Work with CRAN support team to keep Checklist for New Submissions up-to-date
    - c.f. [collaborative list of things to check](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prepare-for-cran)

&gt; I want at least two female core Python Devs in the next year
