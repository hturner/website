# MiR Community

Medium post by Danielle Smalls-Perkins and Dorris Scott: [MiR: A Community for Underrepresented Minority useRs](https://twitter.com/Dorris_Scott/status/1233475276274880518?s=20)

# Disabled and Deaf useRs

???

- Some people do not identify as disabled (e.g. some Deaf, Blind, Autisitic folk
etc)
- Some prefer person-first, some prefer identity first
---

# R for Blind Users

Jonathan Godfrey has provided many resources

- [Let's Use R Now (LURN)](https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/lurn/front.html) e-book for blind users
- [BlindRUG](https://www.nfbnet.org/mailman/listinfo/blindrug_nfbnet.org) mailing list
- BrailleR package
 - text descriptions of graphics
 - WriteR software to produce R markdown documents
- Tips for writing [accessible markdown documents](https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/)

---

# Accessibility of R Conferences/Events

Liz Hare has been leading the development of
[best practices for events](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/master/DRAFTEventBestPracticesDisability.md)

Informed call for proposals for useR! 2021, e.g. asking if venue had
 - step-free access
 - disabled parking close to venue
 - gender-neutral bathrooms
 - policy allowing children on premises

Aim to integrate recommendations throughout organization for 2021.

---

# What you can do

- Educate yourself/others on accessibility
- Expect disabled people at your events
   - including as speakers, chairs, committee members, etc
   - remove barriers to inclusion, don't wait for people to ask
- Give feedback on/help develop best practices
   - (R-specific) advice for creating accessible/inclusive presentations
   - advice for social media managers

???

- chicken-and-egg problem (don't see them so don't accommodate; don't see them because their no accommodated)
 - planning with accessibility in mind from the start saves time and money over retrofitting.
 - remove barriers

---

# General tips for creating inclusive communities

- Organizers: use best practices in your events
    - Noa Tamir is working on [guide for meetups](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/meetup-advice/meetup_best_practices.md)
- Expand your network
- Support the initiatives of underrepresented groups
- Share opportunities
- Do what you can to lessen/share the burden

# Developer Meetings

---

# Developer meetings co-located with useR!

Directions in Statistical Computing (2014-2019)
 - Both invited speakers and invited participants
 - Mostly R Foundation members, plus special guests
 - Prior to useR!

R Implementation Optimization and Tooling
 - Open call for speakers, open to useR! participants
 - Parallel with useR!

---

# Barriers to Inclusion

Invited workshop
 - Special guests can feel out of place
 - Community members that would be interested are left out
 - Information is not shared

Satellite meetings
 - Not same effort to reach out to underrepresented groups
 - Very little promotion to general community
 - Details hidden away on separate website

Hard for people from underserved regions to get involved

---

# Work in Progress

DSC 2020
 - Speakers are invited, but anyone can attend

RIOT 2019
 - First time RIOT was advertised on useR! 2019 website

Room for improvement
 - Better promotion of events, with a focus on diversity
 - Alternative formats (e.g. breakout session) to enable new contributors
 - Sharing information, e.g. recorded talks, blog post

# Package development workshops

Forwards package development [workshop materials](https://github.com/forwards/workshops/tree/master/York2020_01)
 - Full day and 2 hour versions
 - Workshop run in Auckland, Budapest, Chicago, York, Johannesburg
 - Upcoming Montevideo
 - Working on [guide](https://forwards.github.io/workshops-guide/) for others to run workshop at RUGs, R-Ladies groups, universities, etc

# Reluctance/Nervousness to Submit to CRAN

- Bad experience on CRAN/official mailing list
    - Decide to not to publish/host on GitHub
- Hoops to jump through
    - A lot of information: CRAN Repository Policy, Checklist for New Submissions
    - Feedback can be unpredictable and underspecified
    - Involved process: updating NEWS, DESCRIPTION, running checks and tests
- R-package-devel provides limited support
    - can still be an intimidating experience
    - focus on specific questions

---

# Basic Onboarding?

- Potential for basic onboarding service for first-time (underrepresented) submitters
    - guidance through checklist
    - help with errors/issues that come up in checks/tests
    - help solve issues identified by CRAN
    - give guidance on resubmission as they "graduate"
- Work with CRAN support team to keep Checklist for New Submissions up-to-date

# Python Core Dev: Adding Women to the Team

&gt; I want at least two female core Python Devs in the next year
&gt;
&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;cite&gt;PyCon 2015, Guido van Rossum&lt;/cite&gt;

From [Victor Stinner's PyCon 2019 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3UmUj9h_Eo):

2016: 0 women core devs&lt;br&gt;
2017: 2 women core devs&lt;br&gt;
2018: 4 women core devs&lt;br&gt;
~ 30 active core devs

# Process of Becoming a Python Core Developer

.pull-left[
Mariatta Wijaya described process in her [PyCon 2018 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI)

- Read the Dev Guide [devguide.python.org](https://devguide.python.org/)
- Join core-mentorship and python-dev
- Find issue in bugs.python.org
- Propose pull request

*All* these steps can be done by non-core members

# Getting to be Invited to Be a Python Core Developer

Promotion to core dev depends on trust

Trust earnt by core devs getting to know people via
 - Pull requests (PRs)
 - PR review
 - Interacting on mailing lists, IRC, Zulip
 - Becoming a Developer on issue tracker (able to triage issues)

---

# Mentoring

Victor Stinner in his [PyCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3UmUj9h_Eo)
proposes mentoring as a scalable solution to both *core dev burnout* and *lack of diversity*

Recent/current work by Python Core devs ([Ref1](https://lwn.net/Articles/757715/), [Ref2](https://pythondev.readthedocs.io/community.html))
 - Move to GitHub (2017)
 - Document promotions process (dev guide)
 - Mentoring guide
 - Contributor tutorial
 - Core dev office hours (public and private)
 - Adding enforcement procedure to code of conduct

???

 typically a few emails a week, less onerous than GSoC

---

# More Ideas from Other Communities

Rust: [mentored projects](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/06/27/Increasing-Rusts-Reach.html) (diversity scholarships)
 - mentees invest 2-5 hours per week over 3 months
 - expenses paid scholarship to Rust conference following year

Various: [outreachy projects](outreachy.org) for underrepresented groups
 - paid internship, 40 hours per week over 3 months
 - require mentor(s) to invest 5 hours per week

???

vs 2-3 hours for google summer of code project

---

# Outreach from R Core

- Call for help [Reviewing Bug Reports](https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/10/09/r-can-use-your-help-reviewing-bug-reports/index.html) (R Developer Blog, October 2019)
 - At useR! 2020
     - outreach slot adjoining keynote talk
     - parallel session dedicated to R Core speakers
     - tutorial by Tomas Kalibera on contributing to base R
 - Considering "Requests For Proposals" on perceived deficiencies in R
    - community teams propose solutions

---

# Summary

We can all support community-driven efforts for better inclusion of
under-represented groups
 - Forwards is playing its part here

A lot of ideas from outside and inside R community of how to get more
contributors from under-represented groups
 - Currently don't have enough active members on Forward on-ramps team
 - Needs active participation of R Core and other contributors
